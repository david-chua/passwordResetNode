Node Application to practice creating a password reset functionality.

- Created using Node.JS
- MongoDB
- Express.Js

Note:

Due to this being a practice app, I have kept most of the code in one file, specifically app.js with the HTML in the views folder. In a real live application, it would be better to modularize the code as most apps would be bigger and would contain more code and different models.
